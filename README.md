🚀 Restaurant Management System
=============================

📖 Description
----------------

Welcome to the Restaurant Management System, a comprehensive web-based application designed to manage restaurants' products, categories, users, and authentication. This system allows restaurants to create, read, update, and delete products and categories, as well as manage user roles and authentication. The system is built using Java Spring Boot and is highly scalable and secure.

This system is designed to be modular, with separate controllers and services for each feature. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization, and provides a robust and scalable architecture for handling high traffic and large datasets.
